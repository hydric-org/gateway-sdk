The `singleChainTokens` resource is the high-performance path for token data. By targeting a specific network, this resource offers faster response times and lower latency than its multi-chain counterpart.

Access this resource via `hydric.singleChainTokens`.

## Listing Tokens

To list tokens on a specific chain, provide the numeric `chainId` as the first argument.

```typescript
// List top tokens on Base (Chain ID: 8453)
const { tokens, nextCursor } = await hydric.singleChainTokens.list(8453, {
  config: {
    limit: 10,
    orderBy: { field: "tvl", direction: "desc" },
  },
  filters: {
    minimumTotalValuePooledUsd: 100000, // Filter for deep liquidity
  },
});
```

## Searching Tokens

Search for a token by ticker or name on a specific network.

```typescript
// Search for WETH on Ethereum (Chain ID: 1)
const { tokens } = await hydric.singleChainTokens.search(1, {
  search: "WETH",
});
```

## Why use Single-Chain?

While `multichainTokens` is powerful for discovery, `singleChainTokens` is preferred for:

1. **Transaction Simulation:** When you need the exact address on a specific chain to prepare a swap.
2. **Latency-Sensitive Apps:** Dashboard widgets that update frequently.
3. **Chain-Specific Views:** When the user has already selected a target network in your UI.

## Data Model

The `SingleChainTokenMetadata` object includes:

- `address`: The token contract address on this specific chain.
- `chainId`: The numeric ID of the network.
- `symbol`: Token ticker.
- `name`: Full name.
- `decimals`: Token precision.
