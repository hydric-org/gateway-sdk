title: "Multi-Chain Tokens"
description: "Aggregate and list tokens across multiple blockchains."
---

The `multichainTokens` resource is designed for applications that need a holistic view of assets across the entire DeFi ecosystem. It provides unified models that aggregate metadata, liquidity, etc. from multiple chains into a single entry.

Access this resource via `hydric.multichainTokens`.

## Listing Tokens

The `list` method returns a paginated list of tokens containing metadata for multiple blockchains. This is ideal for building "Top Tokens" or "Exploration" views.

```typescript
const { tokens, nextCursor } = await hydric.multichainTokens.list({
  config: {
    limit: 10,
    orderBy: { field: "tvl", direction: "desc" },
  },
  filters: {
    chainIds: [1, 8453], // Optional: Filter to specific chains (e.g., Ethereum and Base)
  },
});
```

<Note>
  **Performance Note:** Aggegrating data across chains is computationally
  expensive. If you only need data for a single specific chain, use the
  [Single-Chain Tokens](/sdk/typescript/single-chain-tokens) resource for
  significantly faster responses.
</Note>

## Searching Tokens

Search for assets by ticker symbol or name across all supported blockchains.

```typescript
const { tokens } = await hydric.multichainTokens.search({
  search: "USDC",
  config: { limit: 5 },
});

for (const token of tokens) {
  console.log(
    `${token.symbol}: Available on chains ${token.chainIds.join(", ")}`,
  );
}
```

## Data Model

The `MultiChainTokenMetadata` object includes:

- `address`: The canonical address (if applicable).
- `symbol`: The token ticker (e.g., "USDC").
- `name`: Full token name.
- `chainIds`: An array of numeric IDs for every chain where this token has liquidity.
- `logoUrl`: A verified icon for the asset.
