The hydric Gateway SDK is distributed via NPM. It's designed to work in both Node.js and modern browser environments.

## Installation

Install the package using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @hydric/gateway
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @hydric/gateway
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @hydric/gateway
```

</CodeGroup>

## AI SDK Skill

For developers using AI agents or LLM-based workflows, we provide a specialized **AI Skill**. This enables your AI assistant to understand the `HydricGateway` SDK architecture, easily find the right code examples and find resources in the documentation.

### Quick Installation

Add the skill to your project using [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/):

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/hydric-org/skills --skill hydric-gateway-js-ts-sdk-user
```

after running this command, your AI assistant will have access to the hydric Gateway SDK skill.

## Quickstart

To use the SDK, you'll need an API key from the [hydric Dashboard](https://dashboard.hydric.org).

Initialize the client and start fetching data:

```typescript
import { HydricGateway } from '@hydric/gateway';

// Initialize the client
const hydric = new HydricGateway({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key',
});

// Fetch top tokens across all chains
const { tokens } = await hydric.multichainTokens.list({
  config: { limit: 5 },
});

console.log(
  'Top 5 Tokens:',
  tokens.map((t) => t.symbol),
);
```
