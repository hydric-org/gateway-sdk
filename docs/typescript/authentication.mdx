Every request made through the hydric Gateway SDK must be authenticated. This is handled via a **Secret API Key** that you provide during the initialization of the `HydricGateway` client.

## Obtaining your API Key

1. Log in to the [hydric Dashboard](https://dashboard.hydric.org).
2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section.
3. Generate a new key or copy an existing one.

<Warning>
  Your API key is secret. Never commit it to version control or expose it in client-side code without proper environment variable injection and proxying if necessary for your use
  case.
</Warning>

## Using the API Key

The key is passed to the `HydricGateway` constructor. Once set, the SDK automatically includes it in the `Authorization` header of every request.

```typescript
import { HydricGateway } from '@hydric/gateway';

const hydric = new HydricGateway({
  apiKey: process.env.HYDRIC_API_KEY, // Recommended approach
});
```

## Security Best Practices

### Use Environment Variables

Never hardcode your API key. Use `.env` files or your platform's secret management (e.g., Vercel, AWS Secrets Manager).

### Client-Side Security

If you are building a frontend application:

- **Proxy Requests:** Consider routing requests through your own backend to keep the API key hidden from the browser.
- **Allowed Domains:** In the hydric Dashboard, you can (soon) restrict keys to specific domains or IP addresses to prevent unauthorized use.

## Validation Errors

If you initialize the client without a key or with an invalid key, the SDK will throw an error:

- **Missing Key:** Throws `HydricInvalidParamsError` immediately during instantiation.
- **Invalid Key:** The server will return a 401 Unauthorized status, throwing a `HydricUnauthorizedError`.

```typescript
try {
  const hydric = new HydricGateway({ apiKey: '' });
} catch (error) {
  // Catching "API key is required"
}
```
